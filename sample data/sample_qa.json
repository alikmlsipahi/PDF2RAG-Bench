See page 21 for details about the deductible. - Copays (copayments) - A copay is a set amount you pay when you get certain medical services. For example, you pay a copay when you see your doctor for a sore throat, or when you get outpatient surgery at a hospital. The dollar amount of your copay varies based on the service you're getting and the provider you're using. See pages 21-25 for details about copays. - Coinsurance - This is your share of the cost of a covered service when the service isn't covered at $100 \\%$. For example, if the Plan pays $80 \\%$ of the allowed amount for a service, you are responsible for paying the other $20 \\%$. See page 25 .",
